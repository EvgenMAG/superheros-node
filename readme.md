Talking about what is going on under the skin?

Backend has been built on Express using database connected to MongoDB and
Cloudinary for saving pictures.

There have been developed all necessary routes for CRUD operation. API allows
create, update and delete hero item, delete pictures for particular hero. There
implemented pagination for get route.
